                The word steganography comes from the Greek words steganos, meaning "covered" or "hidden," and graphia,
                 meaning "writing." Steganography can be used to hide text, video, images, or audio data.
                 It has been around for centuries and has evolved with the advent of computers and the internet.
                 Steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data.
                 Examples of steganography include embedding a secret piece of text inside a picture or hiding a 
                 secret message or script inside a Word or Excel document.

        <h1>ABOUT STEAGNOGRAPHY </h1>
        <p> Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another message or physical object 
            to avoid detection. Steganography can be used to hide virtually any type of digital content, 
            including text, image, video, or audio content. That hidden data is then extracted at its destination.

            The term ‘steganography’ comes from the Greek words ‘steganos’ (which means hidden or covered) and
             ‘graphein’ (which means writing). Steganography has been practiced in various forms for thousands of
              years to keep communications private. For example, in ancient Greece, people would carve messages on 
              wood and then use wax to conceal them. Romans used various forms of invisible inks, which could be 
              deciphered when heat or light were applied.

             Image Steganography, as the name implies, is the process of concealing data within an image file. The
             image chosen for this purpose is referred to as the cover image, and the image obtained after
              steganography is referred to as the stego image.
